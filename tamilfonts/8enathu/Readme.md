# Kavivanar
Kavivanar is a unique handwriting font that supports the Tamil and Latin scripts.
It is somewhat bold, and slightly slanted, a typical Tamil handwriting style where an incline is popular.
The letterforms show a calligraphic pen stress that brings an aliveliness to the letters, and provides texture in body text settings. 
It works well with both body text and display text because of the intriguing rhythm.
The slanted letterforms for Tamil are inspired from a manuscript by Kavivanar M. A. Azeez (1948-2002), a Tamil poet and educator who lived in the east coast of Sri Lanka.

Fun fact about the name of the font: Neythal is a [Tamil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) word and it's the word for seashore and adjoining lands. I love places with lovely seashore, very much.
